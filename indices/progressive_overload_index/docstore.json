Perhaps you\u2019re new to lifting and you\u2019re wondering exactly what progressive overload \nis. Well, progressive overload simply means that you\u2019re doing more over time. For example, you could \nbe adding some weight to the bar, doing more reps, and/or having more productive training sessions. \nYou won\u2019t find many comprehensive articles on this topic as it\u2019s pretty difficult to write an all-\nencompassing article pertaining to progressive overload. Due to the large variance in the fitness abilities \nof people when they first embark on a training regimen, it\u2019s a little more complicated than simply telling \nsomeone to \u201cadd 10 more pounds to the bar each week,\u201d or \u201cdo 2 more reps with the same weight each \nweek.\u201d  \n \nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t give you a precise prescription. In order for me to know exactly how you should \nprogress, I have to be with you, watching you train. Since I can\u2019t be there with you, I\u2019ll give you some \nadvice to adhere to, which should make your life easier.  \n \n1. Progressive Overload starts with whatever you can do with perfect technical form \n \nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re brand new to a particular exercise. You\u2019ve seen all sorts of Youtube videos of \nstrong lifters hoisting hundreds of pounds. You think you\u2019re a strong cat, so you load up the \nplates and find that the exercise just doesn\u2019t feel right. It feels awkward, unnatural, you don\u2019t \nfeel the right muscles working, and it even \nseems jarring on the joints and potentially \ninjurious. This exercise is definitely not right for \nyou, right? Wrong! The exercise is probably \nright for you, but your approach was all wrong.  \n \nDo not concern yourself with what others use \nfor loading. When you begin an exercise, start \nout as light as possible and gradually work your \nway up. Let me provide you with two examples \n\u2013 the starting point for the weakest non-elderly \nand non-injured beginner I\u2019ve trained as well as \nthe starting point for the strongest beginner I\u2019ve \ntrained. Chances are you\u2019ll fall somewhere in \nbetween these two individuals.  \n \nThe weakest beginner I ever trained (a middle-\nage woman who had been completely", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2307, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d515ecd-f1a9-49b9-a2ec-672a793bd0ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d515ecd-f1a9-49b9-a2ec-672a793bd0ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "09124500-8e61-4984-bacf-5953a5f0c845", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}, "hash": "f1954ded54524f9920ec5671ceb49d9e42b911a29bb30c0adf591e944f75eded", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "2 |  P a g e\n \nsedentary for around 15-years) had to start out with bodyweight high box squats on the \nadjustable step-up platform so that she was only descending around 8 inches before sitting on \nthe box. This same client also performed glute bridges, step-ups from a 4\u201d step, and hip-hinge \ndrills \u2013 all done with just bodyweight.  \n \nBut guess what? She was squatting, hip thrusting, step-upping, and deadlifting. Granted, she \nwas performing the most remedial variations of those exercises, but this is what was right for \nher at the time. Within six months she was doing goblet full squats, barbell hip thrusts, Bulgarian \nsplit squats, and deadlifts from the floor with 95 lbs.  \n \nConversely, the strongest beginner (a high-school wrestler) I ever trained was able to use 185 lbs \nfor full squats, 225 lbs for deadlifts, 225 lbs for hip thrusts, 155 lbs for bench press, and could do \nBulgarian split squats, single leg hip thrusts, and chin ups with great form. Though he was an \nathlete, surprisingly he had never lifted weights before. Sports had strengthened his legs and \nupper body so that he was able to start out at a much more advanced level than most \nbeginners. Even my (at the time) 13-year old niece, a very good volleyball player, full squatted \n95 lbs, trap bar deadlifted 135 lbs, and single leg hip thrusted (all with excellent form) in her \nvery first weight training session.  \n \nBut these people are not you. You\u2019ll find that due to your unique body type, you\u2019ll have an \nadvantage with some exercises and a huge disadvantage with others. Long femurs? You \nprobably won\u2019t set any squat records, but your weighted back extension strength is going to kick \nsome serious butt. Long arms? Kiss your bench press records goodbye, but you\u2019re gonna be a \ndeadlifting rockstar.  \n \nFigure out where you belong on the regression-progression continuum (this is basically a list of \neach variation of an exercise from the easiest possible version to the most challenging version) \nand start getting stronger.   \n \n2. Progressive Overload for beginners involves a few tenets \n \nProgressive overload methodology is different for \nbeginners compared to more advanced lifters. It\u2019s also \ndifferent for men compared to women and for those \ncarrying a lot of muscle versus those not carrying much \nmuscle. For example, I can\u2019t just tell a woman who is \nbrand new to strength training to just add ten pounds \nto the bar for squats and deadlifts each week. First of \nall, chances are some work has to be done just to get \nher to squat and deadlift properly, before ever focusing \non load.

If you keep squatting your own \nbodyweight (or rack pulling 65lbs) for 3 sets of 10, \nbut each week you descend an inch deeper, that\u2019s \nprogressive overload. Eventually you\u2019ll be using a \nfull range of motion and can then concern yourself \nwith adding load.  \n \nWith exercises that have you moving a significant \nportion of your body, such as squats, hip thrusts, \nback extensions, and lunges, you must master your \nown bodyweight before adding load. I like my \nclients to be able to perform 3 sets of 20 full-ROM \nreps with bodyweight exercises before adding load.  \n \nFurthermore, many lifts require very small jumps in load over time, and attempts in these \nparticular exercises should usually involve jumps in repetitions instead of load. This applies to \nlifts that utilize smaller loads, for example curls and lateral raises, in addition to challenging \nbodyweight movements such as skater squats, single leg RDLs, single leg hip thrusts, and \nprisoner single leg back extensions.  \n \nThis is especially important for women or smaller men when access to smaller plates (1.25lb or \n2.5lb plates) or smaller jumps in dumbbell (ex: 17.5lbs) or kettlebell loads aren\u2019t possible. Think \nabout it \u2013 going from 50 to 55 lb dumbbells is a 10% jump in weight. However, going from 10 to \n15 lb dumbbells is a 50% jump in weight. You cannot expect someone to make a 50% jump in \nload and execute the same number of repetitions as the week before, but you can expect them \nto get another rep or two with the same load. So let\u2019s say that one week you perform dumbbell \nrear delt raises with 10lbs for 10 reps. The next week, rather than up the load to 15lbs, try \nperforming 12 reps with the 10lb weights. When you get to a point where you can do a couple \nof sets of 20 reps, then jump the weight up to 15 lbs.  \n \n3. Progressive Overload can be achieved in a variety of ways (12 primary ways I can think of) \n \nRemember, progressive overload is simply \u201cdoing more over time.\u201d There are many ways to go \nabout this. In this article, I\u2019ve already mentioned progressing in range of motion, repetitions, \nand load. In the beginning, you want to progress in range of motion and form. Yes, if you do the \nsame workout you did the week before, but with better form, that\u2019s progression.

But these aren\u2019t the only ways to progress. Here are \nall the practical ways I can think of: \n \n\uf0b7 Lifting the same load for increased distance (range of motion) \n\uf0b7 Lifting the same load and volume with better form, more control, and less effort \n(efficiency) \n\uf0b7 Lifting the same load for more reps (volume) \n\uf0b7 Lifting heavier loads (intensity of load) \n\uf0b7 Lifting the same load and volume with less rest time in between sets (density) \n\uf0b7 Lifting a load with more speed and acceleration (intensity of effort) \n\uf0b7 Doing more work in the same amount of time (density) \n\uf0b7 Doing the same work in less amount of time (density) \n\uf0b7 Doing more sets with the same load and reps (volume) \n\uf0b7 Lifting the same load and volume more often throughout the week (frequency) \n\uf0b7 Doing the same work while losing body mass (increased relative volume) \n\uf0b7 Lifting the same load and volume and then extending the set past technical failure with \nforced reps, negatives, drop sets, static holds, rest pause, partial reps, or post-\nexhaustion (intensity of effort) \nJust remember, improvements in form and ROM come first, and increases in reps and load come \nsecond.  \n \n4. Progressive Overload will never be linear \n \nMany strength coaches love to tell the story about Milo of Croton to illuminate the merits of \nprogressive overload. Legend has it that Milo used to pick up a baby calf every day and carry it \naround on his shoulders. As the calf \ngrew, Milo got stronger. Eventually \nMilo was hoisting a full-size bull and \nbusting out sets of yoke walks like it \nain\u2019t no thang. Pretty sweet story, \nright? \n \nUnfortunately this story is a crock of \nbull (pun intended).

The body doesn\u2019t work that way. Adaptations happen in \nwaves. Sometimes you\u2019ll make big jumps in a single week in a particular quality, while other \ntimes you\u2019ll stall for three months in another quality. Over the long haul, everything goes up, but \nit\u2019s a windy road. There are physiological reasons for this phenomenon, which is beyond the \nscope of this article.  \n \nHowever, let\u2019s pretend for a minute that you could make linear progress for an entire year on a \nparticular lift. A 10lb jump per week equates to 520lbs in a year. Even a 5lb jump per week \nequates to 260lbs in a year. Moreover, a 1 rep jump per week equates to 52 reps in a year, while \na 1 rep jump per month equates to 12 reps in a year. You won\u2019t gain 260-520lbs in a year on any \nsingle lift. And you won\u2019t gain 12-52 reps on most lifts either.  It just ain\u2019t happening. Some \nsessions you\u2019ll be surprisingly strong and make big gains, some sessions you\u2019ll simply tie your \nprevious efforts, and some sessions you\u2019ll actually be weaker and go backwards. But every six \nmonths you\u2019ll likely be stronger and fitter.  \n \n \n \nThese charts depict a woman\u2019s progress over a one-year period in bodyfat percentage and lean \nbody mass in kilograms. She made the most dramatic transformation I\u2019ve ever seen to date, but \nnotice the non-linear adaptations. Also notice the drop in muscle, despite doing everything \nright. This woman gained a ton of strength on squats, deadlifts, hip thrusts, bench press, military \npress, rows, and chins, she never missed a training session, and she ate perfectly for an entire \nyear, yet she lost around 11 lbs of muscle during her year-long pursuit of getting into contest \nshape of below 10% bodyfat. Nevertheless, she won her first figure competition and is now a \npopular figure competitor.  \n \n5. Progressive Overload will never be as fun as it is during your first 3 months of lifting \n \nIf you\u2019re a beginner, sit back and enjoy the ride!

Just don\u2019t get spoiled, your rate of gain will slow \ndramatically and pretty soon you\u2019ll be just like the rest of us \u2013 fighting like hell for those PR\u2019s.  \n \n6. Progressive Overload for veteran lifters requires serious strategy and specialization \n \nAs a beginner, you can pretty much do anything and gain strength as long as you\u2019re consistent. \nAfter a couple of years of solid training, however, you have to be clever about your \nprogramming in order to continue to reach new levels of strength. You\u2019ll need to rotate your \nlifts, plan your program designs intelligently, fluctuate your training stress, and tinker around \nwith methodologies. Eventually it becomes very difficult to pack more pounds onto a particular \nlift or even gain another rep.  \n \n7. Progressive Overload is much harder when you\u2019re losing weight \n \nUnless you\u2019re a beginner, it\u2019s highly challenging to increase your strength while simultaneously \ndropping significant weight. In fact, \nsimply maintaining your strength \nwhile losing weight is a form of \nprogressive overload as you\u2019d be \nincreasing your relative strength \n(strength divided by bodyweight) \nand therefore \u201cdoing more over \ntime.\u201d  \n \nSome lifts are more affected by \nweight loss than others. Squats and \nbench press tend to take a big dive, \nwhereas deadlits can sometimes stay put. Your strength endurance on bodyweight exercises for \nthe upper body will see a huge jump when you lose weight, however, so enjoy the boosts in reps \non push-ups, chins, dips, and inverted rows.  \n \n8. Progressive Overload sometimes has a mind of its own \n \nQuite often you\u2019ll do everything right, but you won\u2019t get stronger. The plan just won\u2019t work. \nYou\u2019ll be lifting hard, adhering to an intelligent plan, eating well, and sleeping right, and yet you \nstill you won\u2019t set any PR\u2019s. Other times, you\u2019ll do everything wrong, and you\u2019ll somehow gain \nstrength. Your training can be derailed, your diet and sleep can go down the gutter, but you\u2019ll go \nto the gym and set a PR. This makes absolutely no sense and flies in the face of sports science. \nNevertheless, this is just how the body works sometimes. Physiology is tricky and multifactorial. \nDon\u2019t get cocky when this happens and think that you\u2019ve stumbled upon the secret system \n(excessive partying, eating junk food, and training sporadically). Whenever you engage in these \nbehaviors for too long, it will backfire on you, so stay on track to the best of your abilities.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2506, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c35e2a2b-d179-4332-9c0c-449d859f5474": {"__data__": {"id_": "c35e2a2b-d179-4332-9c0c-449d859f5474", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3aab679a-8715-4b01-ba5e-9d9d5f658f05", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}, "hash": "312de6b4b073d99e580330c2aeefc9cc6e92d49376e62f4b979b5cbc51d9dea0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "7 |  P a g e\n \n \n9. Progressive Overload should never be prioritized over proper form \n \nAt any point in time, if you really want to set a PR, you can just be lax on your form and likely set \na record. For example, you could round your back excessively during deadlifts, bounce the bar \noff your chest with bench press, or use a little more body English with curls. However, this is a \nslippery slope that\u2019s best avoided. Progressive overload only works when you challenge the \nmuscles to do more over time, and your muscles will not be forced to do more if your form gets \nsloppy. Moreover, you won\u2019t be setting any personal records if you\u2019re injured or constantly in \npain.  \n \n10. Progressive Overload requires standardized technique \n \nThe only way you will ever know whether you gained strength or not is to perform the lifts \nexactly the same way each time. In other \nwords, true strength gains require proper \ndepth, tempo, and execution. Many lifters lie \nto themselves and pretend that they\u2019ve gotten \nstronger, but their ranges of motions diminish \nor their form goes out the window. These \nlifters didn\u2019t get stronger, they got sloppier. \nFederations in the sports of powerlifting, \nOlympic weightlifting, and strongman have \ncreated rules for their various exercises. It may \nbe worth your while to learn these rules so that you always perform them properly in training \nand when testing your max. Assuming you can perform the lifts properly, always squat to \nparallel or deeper, always lock out your hip thrusts and barbell glute bridges, and in general \nalways control the weight through a full range of motion.  \n \nHopefully these 10 rules will keep you on track. I have one more piece of advice to share with you. Even \nthe most seasoned lifters often have to take a step back in order to take two steps forward. Sometimes \nwe get caught up in chasing continuous PR\u2019s to the point of altering form, relying on the wrong muscles, \nskimping on ROM, or training through pain. Once per year, I recommend \u201cresetting\u201d your strength levels \nin your pursuit of progressive overload. Throw everything you\u2019ve done in the past out the window and \nstart over using the best possible form through a full range of motion. This is your new baseline. Now \nwork on adhering to that same form while doing more over time. Your body will thank you in the long \nrun for engaging in this simple yet effective practice.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2412, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"c7c2ada8-ab43-42d0-a2f1-ce7c6bfbd547": {"node_ids": ["b4a09868-72aa-44c6-bd1f-36ba717606f2"], "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}}, "09124500-8e61-4984-bacf-5953a5f0c845": {"node_ids": ["7d515ecd-f1a9-49b9-a2ec-672a793bd0ff"], "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}}, "6fdcf688-efe7-495a-90fb-2b9bfc8b4d5f": {"node_ids": ["a3634602-a35e-4335-b1a2-7ebfbd70380a"], "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}}, "a08e4afa-2264-4d87-a09e-bca2769bb08f": {"node_ids": ["21dc9392-4801-4133-96cb-31fb33417a39"], "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}}, "41bdf670-a23a-41b7-bb9c-b7ac28bdaa66": {"node_ids": ["f3563c77-71e1-4b2d-af0c-4f62a88b3194"], "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}}, "70692233-8e69-4f8c-a1f3-5239553f1132": {"node_ids": ["d8ae5c9b-d48a-4200-98b0-1e8433cb730e"], "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}}, "3aab679a-8715-4b01-ba5e-9d9d5f658f05": {"node_ids": ["c35e2a2b-d179-4332-9c0c-449d859f5474"], "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "progressive_overload.pdf", "file_path": "pdfs/progressive_overload.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 642898, "creation_date": "2024-11-20", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-19"}}}}
